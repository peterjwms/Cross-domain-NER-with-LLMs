Caliban was an Outer Rim moon with a frigid climate. Its snow-covered frozen tundra, mountains, and ravines were home to the Qubey species. In 22 BBY, during the Clone Wars between the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the Galactic Republic, Caliban was the site of a battle, in which the Separatist General Grievous captured Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and his clone troopers and took the Jedi's lightsaber.

To comply with the Separatists' demands, the Jedi and his forces began rebuilding a lunar ice bridge that Grievous had destroyed during his invasion of the moon. However, with the help of the Qubey, Kenobi reacquired his lightsaber from the cyborg. After the bridge's completion, Kenobi confronted Grievous in a lightsaber duel and used the Force to bury the Separatist in an avalanche. As he and his troopers left the moon on a gunship, the Jedi ordered the destruction of Caliban's lunar ice bridge so their enemies could not benefit from it.

Caliban was a frigid moon located in the Outer Rim Territories. The moon's terrain consisted of vast frozen tundra stretches, gray stone mountains covered in ice and snow, and deep ravines. A sun was visible from Caliban's surface, and its light made the clouds in the moon's sky appear orange.[1] The moon featured a Type I atmosphere[2] breathable to multiple species.[1]

In 22 BBY,[3] Caliban was the site of a battle of the Clone Wars, fought between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. While invading the moon, the Separatist General Grievous destroyed the moon's lunar ice bridge that connected one side of the moon to the other, which left one Qubey native separated from the rest of their group. Eventually, Grievous captured the Republic's Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi and several of his clone troopers in the conflict, taking the Jedi's lightsaber and having B1-series battle droids surround the group. Grievous then ordered Kenobi and the troopers to reconstruct the lunar ice bridge that Separatist forces had destroyed. When Grievous threatened to kill them if they did not comply, the Jedi countered that forcing prisoners to work violated the Galactic Accords,[1] an established galactic convention dictating rules of engagement in conflicts.[4] In response, however, Grievous only hit Kenobi and insulted him, ignoring his complaint.[1]

Guided by a holographic diagram of the structure they needed to build, the Jedi and his troopers used the provided materials to begin reconstructing the lunar ice bridge over a deep ravine. The laboring prisoners devised a plan to sabotage the bridge and trap Grievous and his forces on one side after escaping across it. However, Kenobi discovered shortly afterward that one of the moon's Qubey had been separated from the rest and remained unable to reunite with their family. Kenobi promised the Qubey they would rebuild the bridge better than before, and the native hugged him. The Qubeys on the other side of the ravine drew a message in the snow for Kenobi to see, indicating they would help attack Grievous upon the bridge's completion.[1]

After coordinating with the Qubey a plan to thwart the Separatists, the Jedi and his troopers continued building the lunar ice bridge. Grievous eventually became frustrated with the slow pace of their progress and confronted Kenobi about it. However, the Qubey then surrounded the Separatist general and latched onto him, distracting the cyborg long enough to steal Kenobi's lightsaber from him. Grievous broke away from the natives in disgust, leaving the site with disdain. Afterward, Kenobi thanked the group of Qubey for acquiring his weapon for him.[1]

After the bridge's completion, Grievous gloated about how it would allow the Separatists to conquer the moon easily. After the Separatist general revealed that he was planning to abandon Kenobi and his troopers to die in Caliban's frozen tundra, the Jedi signaled his Qubey allies to attack. The Separatists scrambled to oppose the combatants and assemble reinforcements as Kenobi engaged in a lightsaber duel with Grievous. In the ensuing chaos, the clone troopers stole the E-5 blaster rifles from Grievous' battle droids and made their way to a nearby gunship in order to flee the moon.[1]

Meanwhile, Kenobi continued dueling Grievous and maneuvered the cyborg to near the base of a mountain. The Jedi then used the Force to cause an avalanche that buried Grievous and the rest of his forces. Though Clone Commander Cody suggested attempting to take the cyborg into custody for the Republic, Kenobi opted to leave the moon before Separatist reinforcements arrived. As they flew away in their gunship, the Jedi ensured their Qubey allies were safely gathered on one side of the ravine before destroying the lunar ice bridge so the Separatists could not use it.[1] Later that year,[3] Cody recounted Kenobi's actions on Caliban to his colleagues, Clone Captain Rex and Clone Commander Wolffe, while on a mission to the planet Hisseen.[1]

Caliban was home to the Qubey, a species of small sentients that spoke an alien language.[1]

During the Clone Wars, a lunar ice bridge spanned a ravine on Caliban's surface and served as the only way to traverse from one side of the moon to the other. The bridge was destroyed by Grievous, briefly rebuilt by Kenobi and his forces, then destroyed again upon the Republic forces' departure from Caliban.[1]

Caliban first appeared in flashbacks in the fifth issue of the Star Wars Adventures: The Clone Wars – Battle Tales comic-book series. The issue was written by Michael Moreci and published by IDW Publishing[1] on September 30, 2020.[6] The flashback depicting Caliban was drawn by Philip Murphy. The comic alternates between referring to Caliban as a moon and a planet. This article assumes the former is correct due to its initial introduction as an Outer Rim moon and the presence of a lunar ice bridge on its surface.[1]

Murphy first announced his involvement with the project on January 23, 2020, expressing his excitement at being able to draw for the Star Wars franchise again in one of his favorite time periods, the Clone Wars.[7] Prior to the issue's release, in two posts on February 22[8] and March 6 of the same year,[9] the artist shared two colorless, unfinished panels of the comic—set on Caliban—on Instagram.[8][9] Murphy was proud of having designed Caliban and its native Qubey for the comic[5] and shared several uncolored pages featuring the planet on his portfolio website[10] and on Instagram.[11][12]
