to the Gala, Darrow marches straight to the Bellona table, jumps on top and walks through dinner plates to where Cassius sits. Trying to make the biggest scene he possibly can, Darrow yells about the wrongs done onto him and the justice he deserves, stirring Cassius to his feet. The Sovereign decides that on this special occasion, she will allow a duel on the otherwise sacred ground. Darrow makes a plea to Nero, begging for his favor in the duel and the blessing to fight not only for his own honor but also that of House Augustus itself. He reminds his liege of Claudius’s death at the hands of Karnus and the growing boldness of Bellona children. Nero agrees and the duel begins. For the first few clashes of the duel, it seems obvious that Cassius, who almost killed Darrow at the Institute, is still the better swordsman. Smiles stick to Bellona faces and even the Sovereign herself seems pleased with her new Olympic Knight. Darrow then drops his facade and reveals that during the time between the Institute and the Academy, he had been training in the art of Kravat with the former Rage Knight, Lorn au Arcos. As they duel, Darrow bests Cassius easily, severing his arm, which forces the Sovereign’s hand to try and stop Darrow from killing her newest Olympic Knight. Darrow, planning on all of this, notes to all how the Sovereign is trying to overrule the sacred laws of the Compact. Duels are to the death he says, and nothing can change that. He moves to finish off his opponent, but Mustang steps in and stops him."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-04-25T06:26:33.023680Z","updated_at":"2025-05-04T23:52:27.590583Z","inner_id":285,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2548,"annotations":[{"id":481,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":7,"text":"Cassius","labels":["Person"]},"id":"K3G9vF277c","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":50,"end":56,"text":"Darrow","labels":["Person"]},"id":"_H_decUiXO","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":67,"end":76,"text":"Cassius's","labels":["Person"]},"id":"PMU0HsJmil","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":100,"end":108,"text":"Reaper's","labels":["Person"]},"id":"1xeZtotxvY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":117,"end":124,"text":"Bellona","labels":["NORP"]},"id":"57Tma18JeZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":158,"end":164,"text":"Darrow","labels":["Person"]},"id":"U0FRmQ9OBT","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":173,"text":"Bellona","labels":["NORP"]},"id":"ncTxQC8E-g","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":178,"end":186,"text":"Augustus","labels":["NORP"]},"id":"SaFkawOYuF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":272,"end":278,"text":"Nero's","labels":["Person"]},"id":"ulwQzS-_mu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":284,"end":290,"text":"Lancer","labels":["Rank"]},"id":"7Xk9bal8vs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":308,"end":312,"text":"Leto","labels":["Person"]},"id":"iu_xgZfqQs","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":327,"end":333,"text":"Karnus","labels":["Person"]},"id":"xWxJGfTqzh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":340,"end":346,"text":"Darrow","labels":["Person"]},"id":"We-DjyKZDI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":374,"end":380,"text":"Jackal","labels":["Person"]},"id":"xS9p2yKza7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":386,"end":392,"text":"Leto's","labels":["Person"]},"id":"OkxuJV8I2G","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":431,"end":437,"text":"Karnus","labels":["Person"]},"id":"iA3IyO6bpk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-05-04T23:53:00.463834Z","updated_at":"2025-05-04T23:53:00.463834Z","draft_created_at":"2025-05-04T23:52:37.908544Z","lead_time":30.356,"prediction":{},"result_count":16,"unique_id":"f9bd7332-77d4-4507-9494-3fef84528503","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":2548,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"9ffb80c8-Golden_Son_Book_Two.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Cassius is spared but it is too late to stop what Darrow began.

In the meantime, he brings Darrow to meet with the Sovereign, who is with her grandson Lysander and one of her Furies, Aja au Grimmus. She offers a position by her side, but Darrow rejects. She then challenges him to a game of truths, which if he wins, allows him a chance to get whatever he wishes from her. The game involves sculpted pit vipers, named Oracles, that inject an immensely painful venom when they sense lies. They question each other for information, each confessing many truths, namely the Sovereign who gives information perhaps more freely than is necessary, not believing there is any chance she will lose. Among other confessions, she admits to giving Karnus his extra mystery ship during at the Acadamy. Mustang enters, revealing just how close she has gotten with House Lune. Having now pieced together The Sovereigns plan, Darrow takes the opportunity to ask if Octavia had planned for House Bellona to kill the ArchGovernor Augustus and everyone at his table during the Sixth Course of dinner, she denies it, but the Oracle bites, revealing her lie.
