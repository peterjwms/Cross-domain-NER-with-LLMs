The Comeuppance, otherwise known as Zorii Bliss's Y-Wing, was a modified BTA-NR2 Y-wing starfighter owned by Zorii Bliss, leader of the Spice Runners of Kijimi. Bliss purchased the Y-wing for around 40,000 credits after the First Order began raiding the planet Kijimi by 33 ABY. In 35 ABY, Bliss escaped Kijimi in the Comeuppance before the Sith Eternal destroyed the planet on the orders of Darth Sidious, taking the droidsmith Babu Frik with her. She later joined up with the Resistance in the Comeuppance as a member of the Citizens' Fleet at the Battle of Exegol.

Spice runner Zorii Bliss's Y-Wing,[7] named the Comeuppance, was a modified BTA-NR2 Y-wing starfighter with an armored cockpit module whose canopy Zorii Bliss could remotely open with her helmet. She used technology in her helmet to assist her in combat when flying the Y-wing.[8] The Comeuppance had an upgraded navigation computer and a customizable tactical interface. The ship stored a week's worth of provisions.[3] The ship had two ion turbine engines,[4] a communication system,[6] a hyperdrive,[3] and featured two IX4-B laser cannons.[5] The ship's hull was white with a red pattern. The engine featured six bars, one of which was a light-blue while the others were white.[7]

The starfighter, like all BTA-NR2 Y-wings, was manufactured by Koensayr Manufacturing sometime after the formation of the New Republic began[1] in 4 ABY.[9] After the First Order began raiding the planet Kijimi by 33 ABY,[10] Bliss, who led the Spice Runners of Kijimi, formulated a two-pronged plan to escape to the Colonies: find a ship and secure safe passage. She spent around 40,000 credits on the modified BTA-NR2 Y-wing[3]—which sold for 95,000 credits used[11]—and acquired a First Order Captain's Medallion. Though others thought ill of naming starfighters, she called her Y-wing the Comeuppance; Bliss felt she had a lot of scores to settle. The spice runner left the ship parked in a ravine outside Kijimi City and hidden under a snow tarp.[3]

In 35 ABY,[12] Bliss assisted the Resistance by giving her Captain's Medallion to her old friend Poe Dameron and his companions. After discovering the First Order sought to punish Resistance sympathizers on Kijimi, Bliss returned to the Spice Runners' Den to command the Spice Runners to evacuate the city. Bliss volunteered to take fellow spice runner Lluda in her Y-wing, admitting it would be a tight fit, to which the girl thanked her. After a walker forced its way through the den's front door, Bliss commanded the runners to grab their go-packs and flee. She ordered Lluda to meet her at her Y-wing, confirming the girl knew where she parked the ship before escaping through the Monastery herself.[3]

Bliss realized she could no longer escape to the Colonies without the Medallion but could still leave Kijimi with the Comeuppance. As she pondered where she should go with the ship, she was comforted by her week's worth of provisions on board, though she recalled Lluda would be joining her, cutting the provisions in half. After Bliss reached one of the city's outer walls, she discovered a unit of snowtroopers and Ushar, a Knight of Ren, stood between her and the ravine where she had left the Comeuppance. Bliss planned to detonate a neehwa oil lantern inside a nearby observation tower and reach her starfighter in the chaos.[3]

After setting the lamp to explode and reaching a safe distance, Bliss activated the detonator. However, the First Order party stayed in its location. As Bliss voiced her frustration, Lluda surprised her with a tap on her shoulder. The girl suggested she would distract the troopers while Bliss made it to the Comeuppance. Though Bliss protested and insisted they could escape together, Lluda ran off and began shouting at the snowtroopers, prompting the unit and Ushar to give chase after the girl. Bliss ran for her ship, a difficult task with the shin-deep snow.[3]

Bliss was relieved that the ladder to the Y-wing remained as she moved under the tarp. She climbed up the ladder and triggered the cockpit to open with her helmet. Once inside, she triggered the converters, pumped the fuel line, and activated the repulsorlift for a quick takeoff, hoping the First Order could not follow her. Bliss maneuvered for a safer path as the Y-wing shook from blaster fire pelting her shields. Bliss pondered returning to Kijimi City after escaping through hyperspace to find members of her crew but was unsure where to go after that. As the Comeuppance exited Kijimi's atmosphere, Bliss forgave Dameron for running to the Resistance and decided she would also run to something. Later, as the Xyston-class Star Destroyer Derriphan activated its superlaser on Kijimi, under orders from[3] the Sith Lord[13] Darth Sidious, Bliss went to the droidsmith Babu Frik's workshop to retrieve him before the planet's destruction.[3]

When Resistance General Lando Calrissian and member Chewbacca issued a call-to-arms against the Sith Eternal's fleet, the Final Order, on the planet Exegol,[6] Bliss answered the call and joined the Citizens' Fleet[14] in the Comeuppance with Frik as a passenger and[6] the R5 series astromech droid[15] K3-R1[16] in the ship's astromech socket.[6] After the Citizens' Fleet destroyed the Xyston-class Star Destroyer[6] Sutta,[13] Bliss pelted the cannon of another Sith Star Destroyer with the Comeuppance's laser cannons. She barrel-rolled through the explosion and soared past Poe Dameron's X-wing fighter,[6] replicating his maneuvers and destroying TIE/dg starfighters before him.[17] Dameron inquired who was flying the Y-wing, to which Bliss responded along with Frik.[6] Bliss then transmitted targeting data to the other starships in the Citizens' Fleet.[13] After the Battle of Exegol concluded with a victory for the Resistance, some members of the Citizens' Fleet returned to the Resistance base on the moon Ajan Kloss with the remaining Resistance ships. Bliss was among those that celebrated on Ajan Kloss.[3]

The Comeuppance first appeared in the sequel trilogy film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker,[6] which released on December 20, 2019.[19] The Y-wing was first pictured on September 26, earlier that year, in a preview for the "Resistance Y-Wing Starfighter" LEGO set, which was released on October 4.[20] It was first identified as "Zorii Bliss's Y-Wing" in the Ships & Vehicles: Age of Resistance set[7]—which was released on February 11, 2020[21]—for the Star Wars: Card Trader application,[7] which initially released March 12, 2015.[22] The ship's name was revealed as the Comeuppance in Rae Carson's novelization of The Rise of Skywalker,[3] which was published on March 17, 2020.[23]

A full-size model was created for the Comeuppance in The Rise of Skywalker, the first one made since 1976[18] for the filming of the original film, Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.[24] The model was an update to the A New Hope version, which was modeled by Colin Cantwell and designed by Joe Johnston. Production designer Kevin Jenkins wanted to return to artist Ralph McQuarrie's original designs, which Jenkins described as having a more "rocket ship feeling." The cockpit was removable for filming on a green screen atop a gimbal.[18] Keri Russell, who portrayed Zorii Bliss, remarked how fun it was to be in the cockpit and press a starfighter's buttons. Russell was excited for others to see[18] her[25] in the ship.[18]

The Comeuppance was eventually added to the EA Capital Games video game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes[26]—originally debuted November 24, 2015[27]—and was obtainable beginning January 19, 2024. The Galaxy of Heroes designers were inspired to include the Comeuppance after they added Bliss to the game the previous year. The designers took inspiration from Bliss's arrival at the Battle of Exegol and her relationship with Dameron to name the ship's abilities. The forum post announcing the ship's inclusion in the game, posted on January 16,[26] featured placeholder art by EA Community Manager CG_Tusken_Meathead of the ship with a note stating they were still awaiting approval for the official art.[28] The forum post was updated the next day to include the official art.[29]

In Michael Kogge's Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: A Junior Novel, the Comeuppance is mistakenly called an X-wing starfighter.[17] The novel was published on April 16, 2020.[30] In the JOYMAX video game Star Wars: Starfighter Missions[31]—which released August 6, 2020[32]—the Comeuppance had a cosmetic option to change the ship's trim pattern and color to yellow.[31]

In the non-canon Traveller's Tales video game LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga[16]—which released April 5, 2022[33]—when Bliss arrives at the Battle of Exegol, the Comeuppance is a yellow BTL Y-wing. Bliss also refers to a TIE fighter she shoots down as "sky trash" instead of the Star Destroyer, as depicted in The Rise of Skywalker. After Rey interrupts Sidious's Force lightning, Frik takes control of the Comeuppance—whose model corrected to a red BTA-NR2 Y-wing—and destroys the underbelly of a Destroyer.[16] The non-canon reference book LEGO Star Wars Awesome Vehicles, written by Simon Hugo[34] and released June 7, 2022,[35] established the Comeuppance had sensor domes, could achieve a top speed of 1,050 kph (652 mph), and measured 18.2 meters (60 ft).[34] According to the non-canon reference book LEGO Star Wars Visual Dictionary Updated Edition,[36] released April 2, 2024,[37] the ship had a torpedo bay, rotating turret, and red stripes personalized by Bliss.[36]
