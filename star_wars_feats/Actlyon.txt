Actlyon was a terrestrial planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. During the High Republic Era, a cantina operated in its Actlyon City. The girl Haze Delik's parents worked in the establishment but were killed by stray blasts in a cantina shootout. By 34 ABY, another cantina was operating in the lower district of Actlyon City. That year, the smuggler Ana Tolla's crew docked their starship and the Meridian—the personal vessel of one of the group's members, Izal Garsea—in the world's port in order to restock before their next mission.

The smugglers visited the Actlyon City cantina on their last night on the world, deciding to leave Garsea behind on the planet instead of including her in their next endeavor. Shortly afterward, the Resistance spy Pall Gopal met with Garsea in the establishment and hired her to deliver a package for him to the collector Dok-Ondar on Batuu. The smuggler departed Actlyon shortly afterward, setting a hyperspace course for her new destination.

The terrestrial planet Actlyon was located[4] in the Western Reaches portion[2] of the Outer Rim Territories, situated in grid square K-19 of the Standard Galactic Grid.[1] The Lipsec Run[3] hyperspace route linked the world to both the Rycep asteroid belt and the Outer Rim[1] planet[7] Taul,[1] while another route connected it to the Outer Rim planet Batuu. Actlyon had mountainous terrain, rusty skies,[4] and a Type I atmosphere[5] that was breathable to multiple species.[4] By 34 ABY,[8] the world's atmosphere was polluted and foul-smelling.[4]

During the High Republic Era, a cantina operated within the planet's Actlyon City and employed the parents of the Heliko girl Haze Delik in its kitchens. One night, a brawl broke out in the establishment and both Delik's mother and father were killed by stray blasts. Meanwhile, the girl hid in a storage closet, traumatized by the sound of screams coming from the kitchen.[6]

Afterward, Delik departed Actlyon and joined the Nihil marauders, promising to herself she would never be as scared or helpless as she was in the cantina again.[6] In 228 BBY,[9] the girl reflected on the deaths of her parents on Actlyon. While on the planet Palagosal[6] that year,[9] Delik visited the diner Marl's Good Enough Eats, and it reminded her of her parents' prior workplace.[6]

By the time of the war between the First Order and the Resistance, the musician Pall Gopal settled on Actlyon and began playing with the band Sentient 7 and the Clankers in an Actlyon City cantina. At some point, Gopal started operating as a Resistance spy on the world. He eventually acquired a package that the Resistance needed to send to the Ithorian collector Dok-Ondar on Batuu and began searching for a way to transport it to its destination safely.[4] In 34 ABY,[10] the historian and author Eloc Throno included Actlyon on a map in his Batuu guidebook, Traveler's Guide to Batuu.[7]

The same year,[8] the crew of the smuggler Ana Tolla visited Actlyon after concluding their last mission, parking their ship—and the light freighter Meridian, the personal vessel of the crew member Izal Garsea—in the planet's port. After its arrival, Gopal recognized the Meridian, having originally sold the light freighter to Garsea's mother, Ixel Garsea. He later looked at the ship's manifest, learning that Izal was the Meridian's current owner, and resolved to contact the woman to transport his package offworld.[4]

While on Actlyon, Tolla's crew prepared for their next endeavor by resupplying their ship and completing repairs. Izal begrudgingly completed several tasks for her boss, finding the errands redundant and a waste of time when she could instead be upgrading the Meridian. However, Tolla informed the rest of her colleagues that she intended not to bring Izal on their next engagement to Batuu, despite the smuggler's boyfriend, Damar Olin, remaining part of the group.[4]

On the crew's last day on Actlyon—which was also Izal's eighteenth birthday—Tolla led her companions to an Actlyon City cantina for a celebratory night out before they departed on their next mission. Though most of the smugglers enjoyed their meal and drinks, Izal felt disgruntled by Olin's dismissive behavior and Tolla's disparaging treatment of her. She then fetched drinks for the rest of Tolla's crew, overhearing the cantina's patrons discuss the recent activities of the Resistance fighting the First Order.[4]

Meanwhile, while playing with his band, Gopal surveyed Garsea from across the cantina and recognized the woman. Though he attempted to catch her attention by winking at her from his place on the stage, Izal ignored him. Shortly after she returned to her table, the smuggler confronted Olin for ruining her birthday, as he had not kept his promise of making the day special. However, their conversation was interrupted when a gang of bounty hunters raided the establishment, kidnapping a Trandoshan waitress for her debts. Tolla departed the cantina with her crew as the skirmish began and left Garsea behind, not intending to take the woman with them on the Batuu mission. After making their way to the world's port, the smugglers left Actlyon.[4]

Left alone in the cantina, Izal was approached by Gopal, who then explained his connection with her parents. Following some negotiation, she agreed to transport his package to Dok-Ondar on Batuu, with half the payment upfront and half upon delivery. The smuggler then slept on the Meridian for a few hours before departing Actlyon to deliver the package. As she exited the world's atmosphere, Izal calculated her route to Batuu and then jumped into hyperspace. Later, while on Batuu, the smuggler thought about her time on Actlyon. When she and Olin encountered each other on Batuu, the latter assured her he would not have left with Tolla's crew in Actlyon City if he had not been sure she would be fine on her own. Not long thereafter, however, Izal considered that the group's abandonment of her on Actlyon had been for the best as she helped save the Batuuan farmer Kat Saka's farm, which Tolla's crew had been trying to sabotage.[4]

During the High Republic Era, the Heliko girl Haze Delik and her parents lived on Actlyon.[6] By the time of the First Order–Resistance War, the Rodian Pall Gopal resided on the world. The planet was also home to hundreds of smugglers and pirates.[4] In 34 ABY,[8] individuals of several species were employed in an Actlyon City cantina, including Gopal, a Trandoshan, and two Twi'leks.[4]

Actlyon had a city of the same name with a cantina by the time of the High Republic Era.[6] By 34 ABY,[8] a cantina operated in Actlyon City's lower district, featuring a patio and a stage area for musicians to perform. Actlyon also had a port, which smugglers and pirates used to land their ships.[4]

Actlyon first appeared in A Crash of Fate, a 2019 young-adult novel written by Zoraida Córdova.[4] A mention of the planet was later included in the 2024 junior novel The High Republic: Beware the Nameless, also authored by Córdova and published as part of the Star Wars: The High Republic multimedia project's[6] Phase III.[12] In an interview, Córdova confirmed the reference to Actlyon had been an intentional callback to her previous Star Wars work.[11]
