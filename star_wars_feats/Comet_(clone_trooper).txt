Comet was a Clone Corporal who served in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars, a conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Serving under the command of Jedi General Plo Koon and Clone Commander Wolffe, Comet was part of the clone trooper unit known as Wolfpack—a military unit that was part of the 104th Battalion.

Throughout the war, Comet served on many missions, working with fellow Wolfpack troopers Boost and Sinker early in the war to infiltrate the floating city known as the Nexus on the planet Quarmendy in 22 BBY, as well as performing a rescue mission on the planet Vanqor to save Jedi Master Mace Windu and Jedi General Anakin Skywalker in 21 BBY. Comet also fought in multiple larger conflicts, including the Second Battle of Felucia in 20 BBY alongside Koon, Skywalker, and Padawan Ahsoka Tano, and later the Battle of Kadavo, helping to rescue the Togrutas of the artisan colony. Comet's service continued into 19 BBY, the last year of the war, where they traveled to a moon of the planet Oba Diah with Koon and the Wolfpack, searching for signs of the deceased Jedi Sifo-Dyas.

Comet[4] was created as a human[1] male[2] clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett on the clone homeworld Kamino, like all clone troopers in the Grand Army of the Galactic Republic.[1] Comet served as a Clone Corporal in the 104th Battalion's Wolfpack.[6] The battalion was led by Clone Commander Wolffe and[7] Jedi High Council member[8] Jedi General Plo Koon, fighting in the Clone Wars against the Confederacy of Independent Systems.[7]

In 22 BBY,[9] Comet and the Wolfpack battled Separatist forces on the planet Quarmendy. Under the command of Commander Wolffe, Comet accompanied Wolfpack troopers Boost and Clone Sergeant Sinker and used JT-12 jetpacks to infiltrate the Nexus—a floating city and trading outpost that was controlled by Separatist forces led by Emir Wat Tambor. The four troopers were brought near the station in a gunship flown by the clone pilot Corvis before they used their jetpacks to sneak toward it. The clones' initial approach was undetected, but they were soon attacked by a swarm of D1-series aerial battle droids. They eventually prevailed, but, after their successful infiltration, Tambor opted to destroy the station instead of allowing it to fall into the Republic's hands. The four clones rescued a hostage and tried to fly away, with Comet despairing that the blast radius was going to catch them. However, Koon arrived in another gunship, saving the four troopers. Although they had failed to capture the station, Koon praised their efforts for rescuing a hostage and was appreciative that they had all survived.[5]

After the young bounty hunter Boba Fett sabotaged the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance[4] in 21 BBY,[9] Jedi Master Mace Windu and[4] Jedi Knight[10] Anakin Skywalker landed on the planet Vanqor to search for any survivors of the ship's crew, particularly Admiral Shoan Kilian and Clone Commander Ponds. However, Fett and his allies, the bounty hunters Aurra Sing, Bossk, and Castas, were waiting for the Jedi. When a hidden explosive was detonated, fallen debris landed upon Windu and Skywalker. As the two lay trapped in the collapsing wreckage, Skywalker's astromech droid, R2-D2, returned to the Jedi Temple on[4] the planet[10] Coruscant and informed both Koon and Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano of the two Jedi's current state. Koon, Tano, and the Wolfpack left to rescue the Jedi. On Vanqor, Koon and Tano held the ruined bridge of the Venator in place while Comet and Wolffe rushed to Skywalker and Windu's rescue, helping them into their gunship before the Venator fell apart and was destroyed.[4]

In 20 BBY,[9] Comet fought in the Second Battle of Felucia. One evening, forces led by Koon, Skywalker, and Tano approached a Separatist outpost.[6] Koon decided to split their forces to make their attack,[10] with Comet leading a group of clones, including Sinker and Boost, that accompanied Tano around the base's rear wall. As they neared the wall, Tano told Comet to stop and, after the corporal halted the troops, Tano told them that she sensed something nearby. Comet asked her if it was a droid, but Tano replied that it was probably just an animal. Telling the men to remain alert, Comet and the troopers made their final approach to the wall and took cover at the treeline. As Skywalker and Koon made their frontal assault to draw the Separatists toward them, Comet and the others took out the sentry droids and successfully scaled the wall with ascension cables. As Tano covered their backs, Comet and the men secured their position. Comet then told Tano to come up after them, and Tano reassured Comet that she was right behind them. However, when Comet turned away to continue moving, Tano was captured by the Trandoshan hunter Lo-Taren.[6]

Meanwhile, Comet and the men continued on, unaware that she had been captured. They fought battle droids until they met up with Koon and Skywalker's forces in the center of the base. Skywalker complimented Comet before asking where Tano was, and the clone replied that she had been covering their flank. Realizing his Padawan was unaccounted for, Skywalker ordered Comet and the men to perform a perimeter sweep, during which they discovered that Tano was missing in action. Although Skywalker, Rex, and his men searched until the following day, Koon reminded Skywalker that they needed to return to Coruscant, saying that military intelligence could work on locating her. Thus, Comet and the rest of the Republic forces departed Felucia.[6] Tano was later recovered on[11] the moon Wasskah.[12]

Later that year,[9] after the population of the planet Kiros was enslaved by the Zygerrian Slave Empire and brought to a slave processing facility on the planet Kadavo, Koon led the Wolfpack to attempt a rescue of them as well as Kenobi and Rex,[13] who had been captured in their mission to locate the enslaved Togrutas on[14] the planet Zygerria. Comet was part of a squad that used jetpacks to deploy ascension cables for the Togrutas to escape down and onto their Arquitens-class light cruiser,[13] the Hand of Justice.[15] As the platform the Togrutas were standing on began to retract, multiple of them fell, with one of them being caught by Comet. When the survivors made it into the hangar of the cruiser, Comet and the other troopers helped them receive medical treatment.[13]

In the last year of the war, 19 BBY,[9] Comet and the Wolfpack traveled with Koon to the moon of the planet Oba Diah to locate a shuttle that had belonged to Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. As they conducted a search through the howling winds and dust, Comet used a comlink to attempt to contact the other search parties and tell them that they had not found anything. As Comet noted that they were probably way off from their target, Wolffe replied over the comm from a turbo tank that their data indicated that they were very close. Comet assured the commander that they had scoured the area three times but could not detect anything by visual or by using the scanner, declaring the area to be a wasteland. However, another trooper soon discovered the wreckage of the shuttle. Koon later reported their findings to the Jedi Council.[16]

In 1 BBY,[17] Wolffe and former clone commando Gregor fought against the Galactic Empire during the liberation of the planet Lothal. During the conflict, Lothal's native loth-wolves joined the fight against Imperial forces. Observing the similarity between the wolves and the "Wolfpack" nickname for the squad in the 104th Battalion, Gregor commented that Wolffe had his Wolfpack back. Wolffe smiled and responded that they fought just like Comet and the other men.[2]

Comet was a skilled and experienced soldier,[16] serving in Commander Wolffe's Wolfpack. As a corporal, Comet was trusted to lead other troopers and did so capably. In addition to being relied upon by commanding officers Wolffe and Jedi Master Plo Koon, they were also trusted by Ahsoka Tano.[6] As a clone of Jango Fett, Comet stood 1.83 meters (6 feet) tall,[1] weighed eighty kilograms,[3] and had tan skin.[1]

Comet had standard Phase I clone trooper armor with reddish[5] and eventually gray-blue markings consistent with the Wolfpack, including unique markings on their helmet.[4] Comet's Phase II armor was also uniquely painted with gray-blue markings.[13] During their mission to Oba Diah's moon, Comet wore sand-proof armor designed for the harsh weather conditions that included unique helmets and kamas. Comet carried a standard DC-15A blaster carbine[16] and also frequently used a jetpack during missions.[6][13]

Like all other clone troopers, Comet had a behavioral modification biochip implanted into their brain at birth by Kaminoan scientists in order to ensure that they would be complicit in certain orders.[1]

Comet first appeared in "R2 Come Home,"[4] the twenty-first episode of the second season of the animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The episode aired on April 30, 2010.[18] Like all other clone troopers in the series,[19] they were voiced by Dee Bradley Baker.[4]
