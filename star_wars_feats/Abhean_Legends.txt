Abhean was a planet located in the Mid Rim's Maldrood sector, on the Perlemian Trade Route. It was the farthest major world of the Galactic Republic during the Tionese War. At some point after the conflict began in 24,000 BBY, the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion conquered Abhean. The planet saw fighting again in 15,480 BBY, when the Strontium Raid was carried out as part of the Second Alsakan Conflict. Around 15,000 BBY, Abhean became a major hub of the Republic Navy.

Large amounts of war matériel were stolen from Abhean by the Mandalorians during the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY, and the planet fell within the borders of Darth Revan's Sith Empire thirty years later. By 990 BBY, the large starship construction facility known as the Abhean Shipyards was located in the planet's orbit, and the massive Jedi Order praxeum ship Chu'unthor was built there in 400 BBY.

During the reign of the Galactic Empire, a creature known as taozin was supposedly discovered in a shipyard at Abhean, which piqued the interest of a former Jedi intending to use the Force-masking properties of the taozin's scales for protection. Abhean's shipyards were exploited by the Greater Maldrood dominion of the Imperial High Admiral Treuten Teradoc following the Battle of Endor, after which the planet became a part of the New Republic. During the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Abhean system was conquered by the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong.

Abhean was a terrestrial[3] planet[7] located in the Abhean system, a part of the Mid Rim's Maldrood sector.[1] It was situated on the super-hyperroute known as the Perlemian Trade Route,[2] which connected it to the Besh Gorgon system and the Eucer sector's Euceron system[1] and which served as a dividing line between the regions known as the Trans-Hydian and the Slice.[2]

By the time of the Tionese War, Abhean was the farthest major world of the Galactic Republic. During the early stages of that[6] century-long conflict,[2] which was fought between the Republic and the Honorable Union of Desevro & Tion[6] beginning in 24,000 BBY,[2] Tionese raiders conquered Abhean.[6] Mere months before the war's end, a group of Tionese warships destroyed several Republic settlements on the celestial body Okator VIII. A local farm-boy who survived the attack and the destruction of their family's farm later left Okator VIII. Despite being encouraged to tell about the attack on Coruscant,[8] the capital world of the Republic,[2] they instead traveled to Abhean in order to enlist in the Republic Military. Although the boy did eventually become a Republic soldier, the war ended before they could avenge their loss in combat against the Tionese.[8]

Abhean became a battleground again in 15,480 BBY; that year, the Strontium Raid of the Second Alsakan Conflict—one of a series of wars pitting the Republic worlds Coruscant and Alsakan and their respective allies against each other in a battle for dominance—was carried out at Abhean, which remained loyal to Coruscant at that time. Abhean became a major naval hub of the galaxy when the centralized Republic Navy, which had largely been disbanded in the aftermath of the Tionese War, was re-established around 15,000 BBY.[6]

During the Great Sith War of 3996 BBY, the Mandalorian Crusaders passed through the Abhean system as part of a Rimward advance along the Perlemian Trade Route.[2] As noted by Vilnau Teupt in the keynote address "Industry, Honor, Savagery: Shaping the Mandalorian Soul" at Brentaal Academy's 412th Proceedings of Galactic Anthropology and History in 24 ABY, during that conflict the Mandalorians stole large amounts of war matériel from both Abhean and the fellow Republic shipyards at Foerost. Teupt also noted that the Mandalorian Neo-Crusaders used the captured technologies and supplies for the construction of warships during the build-up for the Mandalorian Wars of 3976 BBY–3960 BBY.[6] Between 3959 BBY and 3956 BBY, Abhean was situated in the territory of Darth Revan's Sith Empire.[2]

At some point around 3643 BBY,[9] new evidence surfaced suggesting that the renowned war journalist Choel Nyl, who was presumed to have died at some point, was in fact alive and in hiding. An individual affiliated with one of the parties in the struggle between the Republic and the reconstituted Sith Empire ongoing at the time sent a companion to find Nyl. The companion discovered that the journalist was living under an assumed name on Abhean. In return for his privacy, Nyl shared his notes and eventually revealed a secret that had driven him into retirement.[3]

Jedi ace Crix Sunburris noted in the book The Jedi Path: A Manual for Students of the Force,[4] published at some point by 990 BBY,[10] that they were advancing a proposal to construct a massive new Jedi praxeum ship, named the Sunburris, at the Abhean Shipyards[4] in Abhean's orbit.[5] Sunburris' vision eventually saw fruition[4] in 400 BBY, when Republic Fleet Systems constructed the Jedi academy vessel Chu'unthor in Abhean's orbit.[11]

During the first campaigns of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY, Abhean lay within space controlled by the Confederacy of Independent Systems. At that time, the Twelfth Sector Army of the Republic was charged with engaging the military forces of the Confederacy in Abhean's vicinity. The planet fell within the borders of the Galactic Empire by 17 BBY.[6]

According to a captain's log later discovered in a modified G9 Rigger-class light freighter,[12] in 17 BBY,[13] by the date 18:5:25, a creature known as taozin was discovered inhabiting a shipyard maintenance shaft at Abhean. According to the log, the individual who discovered the creature notified a contact, a former Jedi who was the captain of the light freighter. The latter supposedly took a great interest in the discovery due to the fact that a taozin's scales made their wielder invisible in the Force, which the captain thought could offer protection from the Inquisitors, the Empire's Force-sensitive Jedi hunters.[12]

In order to establish the self-sufficiency of his Greater Maldrood dominion established during the Empire's fragmentation in the wake of the Battle of Endor of 4 ABY,[2] Imperial High Admiral[6] Treuten Teradoc took control of the shipyards at Abhean as well as those in the Taldot sector's Thanos system.[2] By 13 ABY, Abhean had been incorporated into the territory of the New Republic,[6] with its population numbering between one and ten billion around 25 ABY. At some point between 26 ABY and 27 ABY, the military forces of the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong species conquered the Abhean system during its invasion of the galaxy.[2]

The Abhean Shipyards[4] were a large set of starship construction facilities located in the orbit of Abhean.[5] During the reign of the Galactic Republic, the shipyards held contracts for the construction of custom academy ships for the Jedi Order,[12] with the Abhean facilities being the only ones large enough to accommodate the construction of the massive vessel Chu'unthor.[5]

After the Republic was supplanted by the Galactic Empire, the Abhean Shipyards almost exclusively built and maintained Imperial Supply Corps container ships and became known as the creator of some of the largest bulk freighters in the galaxy.[12] Shortly before the Battle of Endor, the shipyards at Abhean were operated by the Imperial Military and produced both cruisers and Imperial-class Star Destroyers.[6]

Abhean was first mentioned in the 2002 Power of the Jedi Sourcebook, which was published by Wizards of the Coast for use with the Star Wars Roleplaying Game.[5] The 2009 reference book The Essential Atlas placed Abhean in grid square R-7.[2] Abhean was subsequently mentioned in an Investigation Crew Skill mission of the 2011 BioWare video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, though the information regarding the mission's outcome was later removed from the game.[3]
